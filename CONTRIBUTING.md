> Tip: Keep your `master` branch pointing at the original repository and make pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css.git
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," fetch the git information from that remote, and set your local `master` branch to use the `upstream/master` branch whenever you run `git pull`. At that point, you can create all of your branches from this `master` branch. Whenever you want to update your version of `master`, do a regular `git pull`.
